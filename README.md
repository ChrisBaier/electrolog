# __Electro Log__

Electro Log is a python-based data-analysis-tool that communicates with a *You Less LS110* kWh-meter that logs the electrical power usage in a household and provides its data via an API specified [here](http://wiki.td-er.nl/index.php?title=YouLess)

The basic functionality will consist of a simple executable file for windows that returns the electricity-usage-data in a .csv-file that can be handled by other software.
